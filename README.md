# Cybercrypt Application

Welcome to the **Cybercrypt Application** repository, the ultimate encryption toolkit designed for enthusiasts and professionals alike who seek advanced data protection. Cybercrypt integrates a comprehensive set of encryption techniques, a random number generator, hash generators, and sophisticated performance metrics, all aimed at enhancing your data security posture.

## Main Features

### Diverse Encryption Methods
Cybercrypt offers a versatile array of eight encryption methods, including but not limited to:
- GCM
- Stream Ciphers
- Caesar Cipher
- Hash Generators

This variety ensures that users can select the most suitable encryption or decryption technique for their data, whether it involves text or files.

### Random Number Generation
At the core of cryptographic systems, our random number generator produces sequences that maximize unpredictability, essential for maintaining the integrity and security of your cryptographic operations.

### Hash Generators
With two robust hash generators, Cybercrypt is your go-to for generating secure, one-way hash values. These are crucial for a myriad of applications such as password hashing, digital signatures, and ensuring data integrity.

### Performance Metrics and Analytics
Cybercrypt doesn't just perform; it also informs. With real-time graphical displays of your encryption or decryption activities, you get immediate feedback on the application's performance. A dedicated section for metrics and stats further analyzes the efficiency of each method, utilizing data stored safely in your browser's local storage.

## User Navigation Guide

### Menu Access
Starting from the `index.html`, users can easily navigate to the main menu which showcases the available encryption methods alongside the random number and hash generators. This menu also leads to the metrics and stats section for an in-depth performance analysis.

### Encryption/Decryption Selection
Choose your desired encryption method to secure your data. You can input text directly or upload files for encryption or decryption, and then easily download the processed files.

### Viewing Performance Metrics
Adjacent to each encryption method's interface, a dynamic graph updates in real-time to display the application's performance. For aggregate data, the metrics and stats section visualizes the average time taken for each encryption or decryption process.

### Data Privacy Assurance
Your privacy is our priority. Cybercrypt guarantees the security of your data by storing all performance-related metrics locally on your device, ensuring that your information remains confidential and secure.
